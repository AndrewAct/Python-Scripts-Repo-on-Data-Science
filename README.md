# Python Scripts Repo on Data Science

# Major Disclaimer:
My intention is not to release these as viable for any production environment. My intention is to inspire others and perhaps help others with a good starting point for building certain solutions in the data science domain.

Script titles are descriptive in keeping with the verbose nature of the python language (a Xteristic that I absolutely love)

A few important caveats on this Repo: 
As borrowed and adapted from https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/64rnbg/update_looking_to_share_my_python_scripts_with/

All my scripts were written on Linux/Windows OS, using Anaconda IDE and sometimes recently Geany. Most of these are written in
Python3. (Some are in Python27 - Linux gedit in this case) and I will endeavour to specify these differences.
They have all been written for my specific environments as above and for the Data Science domain.
I hope to receive feedback on how they work for people and if they find them useful.
The Anaconda IDE gives quite a lot of support for debugging and I endeavour to do as much as I can.
However they are definitely not perfect by any means.


Well, these are the results of actual exercises solved on my journey on www.datacamp.com. You will need to know how to make them work for your specific use case - ASSUMING that you know what you are doing-
And if you really want to understand the underlying methods - you'll have to just take the courses on there.
I can't help with that, but I can surely try to explain a concept based on my understanding and possily implementation


Please note that, NONE of the data sets are available here and the scripts work correctly in the online work space on datacamp.

You will however find datasets online if you google them - there's quite a few out there

These scripts have proven useful  in their adaptability for other projects I am working on which will be shared at the appropriate time, but for posterity, this page has been created.


You may find some functions or pieces of these/my code(s) elsewhere on the web. I do not have any commercial programming
experience, and just like everyone else, I tend to look up how to do a specific function and borrow that.

However once in a while, I’ll find something that’s written extremely well (such as on StackOverflow or other blogs), and
I think "there's no use reinventing the wheel.
I’ll attempt to credit anything of the sorts as I post them, and apologies if anyone is missed - please let me know and I will rectify asap
